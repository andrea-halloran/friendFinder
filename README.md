<strong>Introduction</strong>

friendFinder is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site takes in results from user surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing and deployed the app to Heroku so other users can use it.

<strong>Demo</strong>

1. Navigate to https://friend----finder.herokuapp.com/home. Once the Home screen loads, the user will be prompted to go to the survey.

2. The survey will load, and the user will be prompted to enter their name and a photo. They will then answer the 10 survey question. Once submitted, the app will display their best match.

Note: At the footer, there are links to see the API table, git hub repo, and a link that will take you back to the Home page.

3. To see all possible matches in the system, click on the API table link. This will load their name, picture, and survey answers.
